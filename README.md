### Multi-Format Chatbot and File Processing Application using Langchain, LLM, and Streamlit:

I have developed a project that leverages the power of Langchain, LLM (Large Language Model), and Streamlit to create a dynamic Chat and File Processing Application. This versatile tool enables users to upload PDFs, text files, CSV files, or Excel files, engage in interactive conversations, and perform multiple operations on the uploaded data. To enhance the user experience, the application utilizes Fiass Vector Database for processing PDF and text files. Below is a detailed overview of the project's technologies used.

### Technologies Used:

### Langchain:
Langchain is a language processing framework that enables seamless integration with LLM. It provides natural language understanding capabilities, allowing the application to understand and respond to user queries effectively.

### LLM (Large Language Model):
LLM, based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, powers the application's natural language processing abilities. It helps the application engage in interactive conversations with users, providing a more personalized experience.

### Streamlit:
Streamlit is used to create the web-based user interface of the application. Its simple and efficient approach allows for rapid development and deployment of data-driven applications with minimal effort.

### Fiass Vector Database:
Fiass Vector Database plays a crucial role in handling PDF and text files. Its powerful text-to-vector conversion capabilities ensure the efficient processing of textual data for various analytical tasks.
